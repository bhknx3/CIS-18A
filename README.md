## CSC-18A Java Programming Project

### Project Description
This menu-based program allows the user to create, access, and modify patient records. Patient records include prescriptions that the patient is currently taking. If a patient is taking multiple prescriptions, any negative interactions between them will be tested. If a major interaction between two or more drugs is detected, a warning will be added to the patient's record. A drug search reference is also included. The program is intended for usage by healthcare workers in a pharmacy setting such as pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.

### Purpose
To provide a simple patient-record managing program intended for healthcare providers. The program aims to enhance patient safety by checking for any major interactions between multiple prescriptions for a patient. This allows a layer of protection for the patient in which a professional can reassess the patient's medication management if needed.
