## CSC-18A Java Programming Project

### Project Description
This program allows the user to create and access patient records, which include prescriptions that the patient is currently taking. If a patient is taking multiple prescriptions, any negative interactions between them will be tested. If the program detects a major interaction between two or more drugs, a warning will be added to the patient's record. The program is intended for usage by healthcare workers in a pharmacy setting such as pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.
